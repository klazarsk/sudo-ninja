# About this project 

This toolkit will be a suite of utilities for manipulating large
monolithic sudoers files, inspired by the needs of one of my clients.

## About the naming convention

In the spirit of my love for martial arts, I've decided to name
this toolkit "sudo ninja" with the individual utilities named
after either a tool, art, or technique.

While the art I practice is Tae Kwan Do, I decided to go with a
ninjutsu theme because ninja terminology is better known in
popular culture and the vocabulary is more expansive.

# sudo-katana

Not this file.

Chops, slices, dices, splits, and reassembles sudoer files, and flattens multiline 
sudoer rules.

# sudo-taijutsu.sh

Also not this file. ;) 

Seeks, relocates, destroys. 

# sudo-choho.sh

Named for the Ninja art of chōhō, or espionage.

Sudo espionage! Analyze, report on, and dink around 
with sudoer files. Do nifty stuff like count how many times
a user appears in the sudoers file! 

..and you guessed it. Also not this README.md file.

The current version does nothing yet; I only threw a few code fragments in for a 
placeholder.

# Current Status: 

Right now these utilities are very dangerous at times and should not be used for 
anything except for effing up a system. Realistically, sudo-chopper works very well on 
initial checkin, but: 

a) not all features are implemented yet

b) Some upcoming feature changes will temporarily break things horribly

# Bottom Line:

As I am making it extremely clear that these utilities are not yet feature-complete 
and I am working against the main branch because this was inspired by a specific project,
no one else is using these and therefore there is no risk in checking in broken code at
this time.

How to determine whether or not you are sane: Are you using this utility before I let you 
know it's ready for testing? Whether or not you are sane, is the inverse of this question. 

Actual documentation will be forthcoming later in the project.
