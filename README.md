# About this project 

This toolkit will be a suite of utilities for manipulating large
monolithic sudoers files, inspired by the needs of one of my clients.

## About the naming convention

In the spirit of my love for martial arts, I've decided to name
this toolkit "sudo ninja" with the individual utilities named
after either a tool, art, or technique. 

While the art I practice is Tae Kwan Do, I decided to go with a
ninjutsu theme because ninja terminology is better known in
popular culture and the vocabulary is more expansive.

These were working names during the development cycle but now that we are 
out of the alpha stage with the two primary utilities being mostly feature-
complete.

### Renaming the utilities

Now that this utility is about to enter production the utilities have been
renamed according to purpose and role. 

# sudo-chop

Not this file.

Chops, slices, dices, splits, and reassembles sudoer files, and flattens multiline 
sudoer rules, and also removes expired rules. 

# sudo-cleanup.sh

Also not this file. ;) 

Seeks, relocates, destroys. 

# Roadmap / Coming features

--newerthan and --olderthan for start and end date ranges for expired rules deletion
--expire will accept a tag definition 

Currently the utility is expecting an EXP YYYY-MM-DD string in a comment preceding
the block of rules that the expiration applies to. --expire would ideally accept
a string so that the tag could be "Expire" or "END" or whatever locale-specific
language you choose to use to precede the expiry date. 

Man pages and RPM will be coming by the end of the year.

## About my coding style 

I tend to append semicolons to the end of each line - with my history as a release
engineer it was habit, and also many of my utilities started out as one-liners, and
I regularly pull code snippets out of longer scripts/programs and compress them 
into one-liners when I was a sysadmin at a large hosting company. So, I decided 
to write my utilities with semicolons at the end of commands whenever possible, 
so that if you, the end user, ever find a need to pull some of the code and 
compress it into a one-liner (such as in a cron job for example, or to fix a 
customer's box) it's that much easier for you use a code snippet in a one-liner
script.

I also make use of camel notation with the first "word" being a typing hint, 
because even though bash does not enforce type, it does make the code relatively
self-documenting and more understandable when taking a snippet and repurposing
it.
